 \class BuiltinDefaultCode : public IterativeRobot
 \brief Our big class that does everything.  We didn't bother renaming it.
 
 BuiltinDefaultCode is technically the name of the example class that we first opened, but once we started coding we realized that we couldn't rename the rpoject and didn't want to reconfigure all the build settings from scratch.  So here we are.
